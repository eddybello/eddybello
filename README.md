### Eddy Bello
#### Software Engineer
My legal name is Eduardo, but you can refer to me as Eddy if you'd like! Anyways, I am a student at Florida International University pursuing a BA in Computer Science. Ever since coming across the logical, problem-solving world of coding, I very quickly became more than just interested; I dove right in. Since then, I have learned C++, Java, and Python along with some knowledge on MySQL and Swift. My goals, to keep it short, are to better my coding knowledge in every aspect (interviews, perspective, efficiency, etc.) in order to hopefully land a job where my responsibilities and contributions to the world are fulfilled.
